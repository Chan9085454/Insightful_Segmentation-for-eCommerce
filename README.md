# Insightful_Segmentation-for-eCommerce
Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset:
This assignment involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset, which includes customer, product, and transaction data. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), develop predictive models, and generate actionable insights from the data. The task is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of data science: EDA, building a lookalike model, and customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

Task 1: EDA and Business Insights: Perform EDA and derive 5 business insights. Provide Jupyter Notebook notebook code and a PDF report.
Task 2: Lookalike Model: Build a model recommending 3 similar customers with similarity scores. Provide a “Lookalike.csv” and model development script.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation: Perform clustering, visualize clusters, calculate DB Index, and provide a clustering results report.
